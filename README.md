# WAR

The card game. Google the rules if you don't know them - they're quite simple.

Game continues as each player types "draw" when prompted. Since this game tends to be extremely long, either player can type "exit" to end the game at any time.

There are some things that could have been done more simply. For instance, I don't have to create an extra deck from the cards that are won each round, but my goal was to stay as close as possible to the way the game is typically played by hand.
